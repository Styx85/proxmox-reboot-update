# Proxmox Reboot Update

Home Assistant helper integration that exposes a pending Proxmox VE host reboot as a normal `update` entity.

## What it does

- Receives reboot status directly through its own Home Assistant webhook.
- Shows a pending host reboot in Home Assistant's normal Updates UI.
- Uses the selected Proxmox reboot button as the update action.
- Links the update entity to the selected Proxmox device.
- No `input_boolean` and no Home Assistant webhook automation are required.

## Setup

Install through HACS, restart Home Assistant, then add **Proxmox Reboot Update** under **Settings → Devices & services**.

Select the real Proxmox reboot button. The setup flow displays a generated webhook URL.

You can retrieve the webhook URL later by editing the existing **Proxmox Reboot Update** helper.

## Proxmox status script

Create the status script on the Proxmox host:

```bash
nano /usr/local/sbin/report-reboot-status-to-ha
```

Use the following content and replace `GENERATED_ID` with the webhook URL shown by Home Assistant:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

HA_WEBHOOK_URL="http://homeassistant.example:8123/api/webhook/GENERATED_ID"

if [ -f /var/run/reboot-required ]; then
    REQUIRED=true
else
    REQUIRED=false
fi

curl \
    --fail \
    --silent \
    --show-error \
    --max-time 10 \
    -X POST \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d "{\"required\":${REQUIRED}}" \
    "${HA_WEBHOOK_URL}"
```

Make the script executable:

```bash
chmod 750 /usr/local/sbin/report-reboot-status-to-ha
```

You can trigger an immediate status report with:

```bash
/usr/local/sbin/report-reboot-status-to-ha
```

## systemd service

Create the systemd service:

```bash
nano /etc/systemd/system/proxmox-reboot-status.service
```

Use:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Report Proxmox reboot status to Home Assistant
After=network-online.target
Wants=network-online.target

[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/usr/local/sbin/report-reboot-status-to-ha
```

## systemd timer

Create the timer:

```bash
nano /etc/systemd/system/proxmox-reboot-status.timer
```

Use:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Synchronize Proxmox reboot status with Home Assistant

[Timer]
OnBootSec=2min
OnUnitActiveSec=5min
Persistent=true

[Install]
WantedBy=timers.target
```

Reload systemd and enable the timer:

```bash
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl enable --now proxmox-reboot-status.timer
```

Verify that the timer is active:

```bash
systemctl status proxmox-reboot-status.timer
systemctl list-timers proxmox-reboot-status.timer
```

The Proxmox host will now report its reboot status to Home Assistant every five minutes and shortly after boot.

## Testing

You can test the complete status path manually.

Simulate a required reboot:

```bash
touch /var/run/reboot-required
/usr/local/sbin/report-reboot-status-to-ha
```

Home Assistant should now show the Proxmox reboot as pending in the normal Updates UI.

Reset the state:

```bash
rm /var/run/reboot-required
/usr/local/sbin/report-reboot-status-to-ha
```

The pending update should disappear again.

## Upgrading from versions before 1.1.1

Versions before 1.1.1 did not expose the webhook configuration correctly through the Home Assistant helper UI.

After upgrading to 1.1.1 or later:

1. Open **Settings → Devices & services → Helpers**.
2. Open the existing **Proxmox Reboot Update** helper and choose **Edit**.
3. Copy the displayed webhook URL.
4. Replace the old webhook URL in `/usr/local/sbin/report-reboot-status-to-ha`.
5. Run the status script once and verify that the update entity becomes available.

Do **not** try to add Proxmox Reboot Update a second time. Only one instance is supported. On older versions this could result in the message `single_instance_allowed`.

If upgrading from 1.0.x, the previous `input_boolean` and Home Assistant webhook automation can be removed after the new integrated webhook has been tested successfully.

## Translations

English (`en.json`) is the reference translation. German is maintained with the integration, and additional community translations are welcome.

To add a translation:

1. Copy `custom_components/proxmox_reboot_update/translations/en.json`.
2. Rename the copy using the appropriate Home Assistant language code, for example `fr.json`, `nl.json`, or `es.json`.
3. Translate text values only. Do not change JSON keys.
4. Preserve placeholders such as `{webhook_url}` exactly.
5. Run:

   ```bash
   python3 scripts/check_translations.py
   ```

6. Submit a pull request.

Pull requests are automatically checked for:

- valid JSON
- missing translation keys
- additional or invalid translation keys
- empty values
- placeholder mismatches

Home Assistant's central translation platform is not available for custom integrations, so community translations are maintained directly in this repository.
